# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
The overall objective of our project is to predict accurately with less number of tests and attributes  the presence of heart disease. In this project, fourteen attributes are considered which form the  primary basis for tests and give accurate results. Five data mining classification techniques were 
applied namely K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest & Logistic 
Regression. It is shown that Random Forest has better accuracy than the other techniques.
